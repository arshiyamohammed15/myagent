_**User**_

In your Jenkinsfile you have this stage:

Stage: “Checkout Code”

stage('Checkout Code') {
  steps {
    git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
  }
}

✅ Delete that stage completely.

Because Jenkins already does checkout automatically in:

(Declarative: Checkout SCM)

So you do NOT need a second checkout.
strictly follow the constrains :
CONSTRAINT A: Only include code/text explicitly provided below.
CONSTRAINT B: Ignore all prior conversation history.
CONSTRAINT C: Use static instructions followed by dynamic content; avoid variable metadata before the task text.
CONSTRAINT E: Limit output strictly to the requested answer; no explanations, no extra text.
CONSTRAINT F: Do not repeat input in the output.
CONSTRAINT G: Only perform the stated task and nothing else.
CONSTRAINT H: Do not scan the repo and send as context. Until and unless specified explicitly
